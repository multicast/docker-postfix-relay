The [Debian](https://debian.org/) [Buster](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBuster)
[Postfix](https://postfix.org/) [container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mkovac/postfix-relay/).
It is supposed to be used as a smart relay.

This image is built daily and in case of any security update, the list of
packages is updated, commited and this triggers update of docker-hub image
and all dependant images.

## Quick Usage

Run prebuilt and explore:

    $ docker run --rm -ti =NAMESPACE=/=IMAGE= bash

Typically you want to provide some variables to be changed in `postfix`
configuration. For this, use `--env POSTFIX_var="value"` and the runit
startup script will execute `postconv -e <varname>="$POSTFIX_<varname>"`.
